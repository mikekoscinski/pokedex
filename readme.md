## Description

Is Electrode really the fastest gen 1 pokemon? How many dragon type pokemon are there? Would Lugia best Rayquaza in a battle? Answer these questions and more with this Pokdex app.

View complete profiles on each of the first 386 pokemon. Design your dream team for Red/Blue/Yellow, Silver/Gold/Crystal, and Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald versions.

Users can sort both Pokemon and Moves based on their statistics. Sort pokemon by the highest special defense stat, moves by accuracy, and many more permutations.
